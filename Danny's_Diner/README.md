# Data With Danny 8 Weeks SQL Challenge

Welcome to my repository for the Data With Danny 8 Weeks SQL Challenge. This repository contains my solutions and insights for each week's case study.


### [Week 1: Danny's diner]



Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:
- Sales
- Menu
- Members

You can inspect the entity relationship diagram and example data below.

### Table 1: Sales
The sales table captures all customer_id level purchases with an corresponding order_date and product_id information for when and what menu items were ordered.

## Case Study Questions

Each of the following case study questions can be answered using a single SQL statement:

1. **What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

2. **How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**

3. **What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**

4. **What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?**

5. **Which item was the most popular for each customer?**

6. **Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?**

7. **Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?**

8. **What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?**

9. **If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?**

10. **In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?**
