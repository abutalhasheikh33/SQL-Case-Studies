# Data With Danny 8 Weeks SQL Challenge

Welcome to my repository for the Data With Danny 8 Weeks SQL Challenge. This repository showcases my solutions and insights for each week's case study.

## Overview

The Data With Danny 8 Weeks SQL Challenge is tailored to enhance SQL proficiency using real-world datasets. Each week presents unique datasets and a series of tasks aimed at refining SQL skills and analytical abilities.

## Case Studies

### [Week 1: Danny's diner](./Danny's_Diner/README.md)

**Description of the first case study.**

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent, and which menu items are their favorite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalized experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally, he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

#### Approach

For Week 1's case study at Danny's diner, my approach revolves around leveraging SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the provided datasets—Sales, Menu, and Members. Here’s a breakdown of my methodology:

1. **Understanding Dataset Relationships**: Begin by comprehending the relationships between Sales, Menu, and Members tables to identify key insights into customer behavior and preferences.

2. **Query Optimization**: Use efficient SQL techniques such as joins, subqueries, and window functions to perform calculations and aggregations required to answer each case study question.

3. **Case Study Questions Implementation**: Implement SQL queries to address specific questions posed in the case study, ensuring each query provides accurate and actionable results.

4. **Bonus Analysis**: Additionally, conduct bonus analysis to enrich insights, such as determining membership status at the time of each purchase and ranking customer activities.

Feel free to explore each week's detailed README for specific SQL queries, methodologies, and insights derived from the case studies.
